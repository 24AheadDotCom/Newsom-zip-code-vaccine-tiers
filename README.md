## Data on the 400 zip codes to which Gavin Newsom is giving 40% of the COVID-19 vaccine

See the ["special" zip codes here](https://24aheaddotcom.github.io/Newsom-zip-code-vaccine-tiers/)

### Caveats

1. See the issues discussed at https://github.com/censusreporter/censusreporter/
2. Since the Census uses ZCTAs and they don't match up entirely to zip codes, I'm not clear if the Census or censusreporter adjusts their data when requesting the info for a zip.
3. I tried to put this together as quickly as possible and I might have missed something; I'll double-check that later.
4. Some of the data at map.healthyplacesindex.org spans zip codes; it's not clear if Newsom intends it for the whole zip or just the "unhealthy" part (it's easy to see him giving a $10 billion no-bid contract to a campaign contributor to build a tool to determine if someone is in the "healthy" or "unhealthy" part of a zip code).

### More information

For general information on Newsom's tiers, see the [Covid-19 activism page](https://24ahead.com/s/covid19). That has FOIAs I've filed and a much simpler plan that will save lives: **just vaxing by ICU risk**, not zip codes.
