		<h2>Data on the 400 zip codes to which Gavin Newsom is giving 40% of the COVID-19 vaccine</h2>

		<p>California governor Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) is allocating 40% of the state's COVID-19 vaccines to the most "unhealthy" 400 zip codes in the state.</p>

		<p>The table below has data derived from map.healthyplacesindex.org and censusreporter.org showing the data on each of those zips. Indexes 0 to 399 are "unhealthy", the rest are "healthy".</p>

		<p>Despite what you might expect - or simply because he doesn't think things through - <strong>Newsom is allocating 40% of the doses to 60% of the state's population</strong>. He's also allocating 10% to the state's teachers (most likely very loosely-defined). Thus, leaving teachers out of it, 60% of the state's doses will go to 40% of the population. Of course, because he's discriminating against people based on where they live (which in many cases corresponds to their race), the 60% in "unhealthy" zip codes can get doses wherever they want, while the 40% in "healthy" zip codes won't be able to get doses meant for those in the special "unhealthy" zip codes. If it all sounds like Jim Crow, that's because it's the suede-denim version of it.</p>

		<p>Here's aggregate data:
			<table style="margin:1rem;cellspacing:2rem;">
				<tr><td>Total</td> <td>38,745,050</td></tr>
				<tr><td>"healthy" total percent</td> <td>41</td></tr>
				<tr><td>"unhealthy" total percent</td> <td>59</td></tr>
				<tr><td>"healthy" young</td> <td>11,472,695</td></tr>
				<tr><td>"healthy" older</td> <td>4,466,898</td></tr>
				<tr><td>"unhealthy" young</td> <td>14,743,641</td></tr>
				<tr><td>"unhealthy" older</td> <td>8,061,816</td></tr>
				<tr><td>"healthy" young percent</td> <td>72</td></tr>
				<tr><td>"healthy" older percent</td> <td>28</td></tr>
				<tr><td>"unhealthy" young percent</td> <td>65</td></tr>
				<tr><td>"unhealthy" older percent</td> <td>35</td></tr>
			</table>
			"young" are those under 50, "older" are those 50+. 95% of COVID-19 deaths have been 50+ and the death rate increases the older someone is.

That page also has FOIAs I've filed and more information.</p>
